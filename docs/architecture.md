# Architecture Overview

## The Big Picture

This system manages **work requests** for MAGFest events. A work request is something a department needs: budget items, tech services, warehouse supplies, AV equipment.

All request types share the same workflow engine:

```
DRAFT → [AWAITING_DISPATCH →] SUBMITTED (lines under review) → FINALIZED
```

(The dispatch stage is per-work-type: BUDGET uses it, TECHOPS doesn't — controlled
by `WorkTypeConfig.uses_dispatch`.)

The architecture is **shared chassis, per-type cabs**: the workflow engine (models,
lifecycle, routing, checkout, audit) is shared, and each work type has its own route
package (`app/routes/work/<type>/`) and template tree (`app/templates/<type>/`).
The original budget routes are BUDGET's cab; TECHOPS is the reference pattern for
new work types. See `docs/adding-a-work-type.md`.

## Core Concepts

### Work Type

A **Work Type** defines a category of request. Each has its own:
- URL slug (`/budget/`, `/contracts/`, `/supply/`)
- Line detail model (what fields each line has)
- Routing strategy (how lines get assigned to approvers)
- Display labels ("Budget Lines" vs "Contract Items")

Current work types:

| Code | Name | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| BUDGET | Budget Requests | **Live** |
| TECHOPS | TechOps Requests | **Live** |
| SUPPLY | Supply Orders | In development (models + admin pages in master) |
| AV | AV Requests | In development (feature branch) |
| CONTRACT | Contracts | Future (data model exists, no UI) |

### Portfolio

A **Portfolio** is a container for one department's requests of one work type in one event cycle.

```
Portfolio = Department + Work Type + Event Cycle
```

Example: "TechOps Budget Portfolio for Super MAGFest 2027"

### Work Item

A **Work Item** is a single request within a portfolio. There are two kinds:

- **PRIMARY**: The main budget/request (one per portfolio)
- **SUPPLEMENTARY**: Additional requests added later (zero or more)

### Work Line

A **Work Line** is an individual line item. It has:
- A line number
- A description
- A status (PENDING, NEEDS_INFO, APPROVED, etc.)
- A **Line Detail** with type-specific data

### Line Detail

A **Line Detail** holds the type-specific fields for a line:

| Work Type | Line Detail Model | Key Fields |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Budget | BudgetLineDetail | expense_account, spend_type, quantity, unit_price |
| Contract | ContractLineDetail | vendor_name, contract_amount, start_date, end_date |
| Supply | SupplyOrderLineDetail | item, quantity_requested, needed_by_date |

The relationship is 1-to-1: every WorkLine has exactly one line detail.

## How Approval Routing Works

Different work types route to approvers differently:

```
Budget Line → Expense Account → Approval Group
Contract Line → Contract Type → Approval Group
Supply Line → Supply Category → Approval Group
```

This is implemented via the **routing strategy pattern**:

```python
# Each work type has a routing strategy
class ExpenseAccountRoutingStrategy:
    def get_approval_group(self, line):
        return line.budget_detail.expense_account.approval_group

class ContractTypeRoutingStrategy:
    def get_approval_group(self, line):
        return line.contract_detail.contract_type.approval_group
```

The `WorkTypeConfig.routing_strategy` field determines which strategy to use.

## Permission Model

Access is controlled at multiple levels:

### 1. System Roles (UserRole)

| Role | Scope | Access |
|------|-------|--------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | Global | Everything |
| WORKTYPE_ADMIN | Per work type | Admin for one work type (e.g., Budget Admin) |
| APPROVER | Per approval group | Can review lines routed to their group |

### 2. Memberships

| Membership | Grants Access To |
|------------|------------------|
| DepartmentMembership | One department |
| DivisionMembership | All departments in a division |

### 3. Work Type Access

Memberships are scoped by work type. A user with "TechOps Budget access" doesn't automatically see "TechOps Contracts."

```
DepartmentMembership
    └── DepartmentMembershipWorkTypeAccess (per work type: can_view, can_edit)
```

## Request Lifecycle

Work item statuses (actual constants in `app/models/constants.py`):

```
           [submit]              [dispatch]                [finalize]
┌─────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌───────────┐      ┌───────────┐
│  DRAFT  │─────▶│ AWAITING_DISPATCH│─────▶│ SUBMITTED │─────▶│ FINALIZED │
└─────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └───────────┘      └───────────┘
                  (only if the work         (lines under
                   type uses_dispatch;       approval group /
                   otherwise submit          admin final review)
                   goes straight to
                   SUBMITTED)
```

- **DRAFT**: Requester is building the request
- **AWAITING_DISPATCH**: Submitted; admin assigns approval groups (BUDGET only)
- **SUBMITTED**: Lines under review by approval groups (and admin final, if the
  work type has that stage)
- **FINALIZED**: Locked; amounts confirmed. Work types without an admin-final
  stage auto-finalize when the last line is decided.
- **PAUSED**: Supplementary blocked by a pending PRIMARY
- **UNAPPROVED**: Reopened after finalize

`NEEDS_INFO` / `NEEDS_ADJUSTMENT` are **line-level** statuses (kickbacks to the
requester), not work-item statuses — see `docs/workflow.md`.
